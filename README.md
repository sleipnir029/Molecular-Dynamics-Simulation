# Molecular Dynamics Learning Journey

Welcome to my Molecular Dynamics (MD) learning repository! This project serves as a structured guide as I follow various tutorials to deepen my MD knowledge, build essential skills, and tackle practical simulations. The aim is to develop a solid foundation in MD techniques, model setups, and analysis.

## Contents

- **Tutorial-Based Learning**: Each folder contains a new tutorial Iâ€™ve worked through, with explanations, scripts, and notes.
- **Independent Practice**: Includes exercises to apply and reinforce learned techniques.
- **Simulation Projects**: Real-world applications where I implement MD simulations using LAMMPS, Python, and C++.

## Getting Started

Each tutorial is standalone, so feel free to explore folders in any order. My notes and code comments document key concepts and findings to create a cohesive learning path.

## Goals

1. Build a strong foundation in molecular dynamics.
2. Develop hands-on skills in LAMMPS and simulation programming.
3. Apply MD knowledge to real-world material science problems.

### 1. Binary Fluid Simulation
Performing a binary fluid simulation using LAMMPS. The system is a Lennard-Jones fluid composed of neutral particles with two different diameters. It is contained within a cubic box with perioding boundary conditions.
